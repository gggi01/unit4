# HR DataPress Technology
> Built on `Mar 2020` 


::: tip What Is Tech Inside?
 'HR DataPress' is developed as a [Static Site](https://hr.un.org/handbook/staff-rules) based on [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), a widely-used modern programing language using java script. It is also built with [Vuepress](https://laravel-news.com/vuepress), static site generator created by [Evan You](https://hr.un.org/handbook/staff-rules), creator of Vuejs and formal Google developer.
  
  Its underlying module bundler, [Web Pack](https://webpack.js.org/) dynamically bundles all assets of the application into a single page (or [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). See why it's super fast). 

  On top of this, HR Data Press is built as [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)( or Progressive Web Application) and users can download this site in Windows, Mac desktop or even in Iphone or android mobile.

There are several advantages to using a static site generator such as VuePress. With VuePress, you can focus on writing content using markdown, and the VuePress application generates static HTML files. VuePress also turns your content into a single-page application (SPA), so transitions between pages seem instant and seamless. The generated static files can be cached and distributed across a content delivery network (CDN) for even more performance. For the reader, VuePress creates a great experience.

One of the excellent features of VuePress is it automatically updates your locally running application with any changes you make. To demonstrate, leave the development server running at the command line. Make a change to readme.md file and save it. When you return to the browser, you should immediately see that change reflected without having to refresh the page
