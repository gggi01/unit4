Payment 
 
4. The Education Allowance is generally payable in one lump-sum reimbursement, or through quarterly expense claims in the case of homeschooling expenses, based on satisfactory supporting documentation and receipts.

7. A Staff member on approved leave with pay for two 2. calendar weeks shall continue to be paid such an allowance. In case of leave beyond 2 calendar weeks, the Supervisor should inform the Human Resources office and find alternative replacement. In such a case the Higher Responsibility Allowance will cease to apply. 
 
8. The duties to be performed by the Staff member and consequently the allowance may vary during the period of arrangement following consultation between the Staff member and the Supervisor. The Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that any variation is discussed with the Human Resources office and approved by the Division Head.     
                                                          
 1 For instance, a Staff member who performs 100% of the duties of the higher level position will receive an allowance equal to the difference between his/her base salary and the starting salary of the higher level position, while a Staff member who performs 50% of the  duties of the higher level position will receive an allowance equal to 50% of the difference between his/her base salary and the starting salary of the higher level position.

Annex 2 – Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements 
 
Why Flexible Work Arrangements? 
 
1. GGGI is committed to support workplace flexibility to: a) create a work environment based on performance, mutual achievement and trust; b) attract and retain a diverse and high-performing workforce; c) enable teams and individuals to work productively and deliver strong organizational outcomes; d) improve the ability to meet the needs of our stakeholders; and e) enhance employee engagement and job satisfaction. 
 
How Can you Embrace Workplace Flexibility? 
 
1. There may be a range of reasons a Staff member may request flexible work. Such reasons may range from caring for family members, contributing to the community, maintaining health and wellbeing, studying, transitioning to retirement or managing the amount of time spent commuting. 
 
2. Staff members may request flexible work via application to their Supervisor. In some instances, it may also be at the request of the Supervisor after consultation with Human Resources office.  
 
3. Use of flexible working arrangements will require careful planning and preparation on the part of all concerned. 
 
4. The Staff member and the Supervisor meet to discuss the details of the arrangements; set specific goals, responsibilities and outputs. It is recommended to record the outcome of the discussions by email.  
 
5. It is the responsibility of Managers to properly apply the Staff Rules and guidelines relating to Flexible Work Arrangements. In case of doubt or clarification, the Human Resources office will provide advice at the Staff member and/or Manager’s request(s). 
 
6. Flexible work options available to individual Staff may differ depending on the terms and conditions of their employment and job requirements. 
 
7. The Staff member and Supervisor may agree on one or a combination of these options as a part of a flexible work arrangement. 
 
8. Several Flexible work options may be considered in combination with other provisions available to Staff to achieve greater flexibility, including annual Leave, or other types of leave. 
 

 
62 
 
9. Adjustments to benefits, depending on the flexible work option adopted, may include changes to housing allowance, hardship allowance and cost-of-living allowance depending on the agreed actual work location. Staff and Supervisors are encouraged to consult Human Resources when considering applying for flexible working arrangements. 
 
10. If flexible work is considered not appropriate, a Staff member may still consider various leave options available to them. 
 
Can my Supervisor Refuse to Approve my Request for Flexible Work Arrangement? 
 
11. Supervisors will consider each request for flexible work based on the conditions set in Staff Rule 6.2 4. and the present Guidelines.  
 
12. In accordance with Staff Rule 6.2 4., the Supervisor may not approve a flexible work request on reasonable business grounds, which include, but are not limited to the following: a) the nature of the work is incompatible with the proposed flexible work arrangement; b) the new working arrangements requested by the Staff member would incur costs for GGGI; c) accommodating the requested flexible work arrangement will have a disproportionate impact on other Staff; d) it would be impractical to change the working arrangements of other Staff, or recruit new Staff, to accommodate the requested flexible work arrangement; e) the new working arrangements requested by the Staff member would likely result in a significant loss of efficiency or productivity; f) the new working arrangements requested by the Staff member would be likely to have a significant negative impact on GGGI’s level of service to stakeholders. 
 

 
63 
 
Overview of GGGI Flexible Work Arrangement Options 
 
Options Description Approval Authority 
Considerations 
Option 1 Working away from the office 
An arrangement where a staff member performs their duties from home or another location than the designated office, where consistent with the nature of the work involved and provided they have access to the necessary equipment and may be reached without unreasonable delay by telephone, Skype for business or e-mail within normal working hours. a) Telecommuting (remote workplace within commuting distance of duty station)2 Staff members may spend up to two days per week working from an alternative work site within the same duty station.  b) Virtual Working Staff members may work entirely from another duty station, from one 1. week up to four 4. weeks maximum per year.  
Supervisor 
 
 
• If working away from the designated office involves access to GGGI resources and computer networks, the manager and the staff member must ensure that appropriate security arrangements are in place, and that the staff member complies with the relevant IT policies. • All work health and safety policies and procedures will, as far as practicable, apply in carrying out work away from the office. • GGGI’s staff insurance scheme applies to staff undertaking approved work away from the office. • Staff members are solely responsible for checking whether home-based work has any impact on any existing home insurance arrangements or tax obligation they may have. • Working from home must not be used as a substitute for childcare. Staff must make appropriate childcare arrangements when working from home. • Staff who work away from the office are required to follow the established procedures for notifying status in ERP. 
Option 2 Staggered working hours 
A regular work pattern where start and finish times are flexible. Staff members are expected to be present during a core period of the working day. The core period will be set at each duty station. Staff must complete the balance of working hours for each day before, after, or partly after, the core period. 
Supervisor • Core business hours are set in Staff Rule 6.1.  • Staggered working hours are not generally available to staff working in roles that require presence during specific fixed hours (e.g., receptionist role that requires attendance during normal business hours). • The maximum number of agreed hours worked on each day must not exceed 10 hours, and there must be a minimum of 1 hour break during the day.  
                                                          
 2 For the purpose of these guidelines, “commuting distance” means a distance between the alternate workplace and the assigned office at the duty station that would still allow the staff member to commute to work every day when not telecommuting and be able to come to and be physically present at the office during the required working hours when requested, including at short notice.  

 
64 
 
Option 3 Compressed fortnight 
Under this option, all the hours that would normally have been worked during a period of ten 10. working days are compressed into nine 9. working days by distributing among these nine days the hours that would otherwise have been worked on the tenth day. This redistribution of normal working hours allows staff members, every other week, to take off the last day of the normal work week (Friday). 
Supervisor • Salary, leave and other entitlements and benefits will generally not change. • Staff who work a compressed fortnight should work to an agreed fortnightly schedule and should not accrue and carry forward hours to the next fortnightly period. • The maximum number of agreed hours worked on each day must not exceed 10 hours and there must be a minimum of 30 mins break during the day. 
Option 4 Part-time work 
An agreed work arrangement where a staff member chooses to reduce their employment fraction, commonly from full-time to part-time, on a temporary basis for personal reasons. 
Supervisor and Division Head / Head of Office at country level 
• Salary, leave, other entitlements and benefits will apply on a pro rata basis. • It is recommended that part-time arrangements be considered in blocks of days of half-days, for instance four days or three and a half days. • A notice period will apply if the Staff member wants to return to full-time or increase their fraction before the agreed date, should the Staff member’s circumstances change. The recommended notice period is 4 weeks and should be agreed on by the Supervisor and the Staff member 
Option 5 Job share 
An employment arrangement where two (or more) staff members, each working part-time, share all the duties and responsibilities of a fulltime position. 
Supervisor and Division Head / Head of Office at country level 
• Job share can be considered either during recruitment for a position or when a staff member requests to work part-time. • Job sharers may work split days, split weeks or alternate weeks. • Salary, leave, other entitlements and benefits will apply on a pro rata basis.

Annex 3 - Guidelines on Informal Conflict Resolution 
 
Introduction 
 
1. These Guidelines are intended to complement the provisions on administration of justice, grievances and appeals in the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules. 
 
2. Staff Rule 12.1 encourages staff members and supervisors to address and resolve work place related concerns, disputes and grievances in an informal manner.   To this end, several resources have been established to assist staff in their efforts to address workplace issues in an informal manner. 
 
Purpose 
 
3. The purpose of these Guidelines to provide several resources which staff may use to resolve workplace issues, specifically the Ombudsman, Mediation, and the Respectful Workplace Advisors. 
 
The Ombudsman 
 
 
3. The Ombudsman is an impartial, confidential and independent source of assistance in the resolution of workplace concerns, disputes and grievances of any kind.  The Ombudsman is an informal resource, not a decision-maker or a formal investigator. 
 
4. The Ombudsman function requires high standards of professionalism, as well as the core principles of neutrality, informality, independence, confidentiality, and impartiality, and competency to solve problems and prevent and manage conflicts in the workplace. The Ombudsman will be sourced externally after a competitive selection process, after consultation with the Staff Council and after final decision of the Director-General.   
 
5. Any staff member can request a confidential meeting with the Ombudsman about any type of workplace concern and dispute. The Ombudsman can advise staff seeking the Ombudsman’s advice (of their options, and of the different avenues open to them to address their concern. An Ombudsman advocates for fair processes but does not serve as an advocate for any party in a dispute. The Ombudsman may, at his or her discretion, decline to consider cases that appear to be not appropriate or frivolous. 
 
6. In the exercise of these duties, the Ombudsman is independent of any group or official and shall, in the performance of these duties, be free from interference, control, limitation or penalty.  
 
7. The Ombudsman shall carry its function observing strict confidentiality and not disclose the identity of those consulting the function, or any information provided in the performance of their duties to any official or organ of GGGI. All records of the Ombudsman shall be considered confidential and handled accordingly.  The Ombudsman can in his or her discretion in exceptional cases decide on sharing such information if there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm, in which case only information required to avert such threat.  In addition, the Ombudsman may be authorized by the relevant staff member to share certain information. However, 

 
66 
 
even when authorized to share information, the Ombudsman exercises discretion over whether and how to do so.  
 
8. The Ombudsman shall not be compelled to be a witness in any formal appeal and arbitral processes set out in Chapter 12 of the Staff Rules about concerns brought to his or her attention.  
 
9. The Ombudsman may request access to GGGI information, including records concerning staff, to get a better understanding of the issues of concern. However, the Ombudsman will not disclose any information that is intended as confidential.  
 
10. The Ombudsman is a source of systemic feedback for the organizations. In this role, the Ombudsman can identify and bring to the attention of the governing organs management, HR and others in the organization the trends and systemic issues that may be impacting GGGI’s capacity to realize its vision of a workplace that is respectful, safe and that recognizes diversity. 
 
11. The Ombudsman shall issue an annual report that shall include an overview of the Ombudsman’s activities and may include also comments on policies, procedures and practices that have come to the Ombudsman’s attention.  
 
12. The Ombudsman can provide different types of conflict resolution and skill-building services, including mediation, group facilitation, coaching and training. The Ombudsman also conduct outreach activities to increase the awareness and understanding of the services among staff members. 
 
13. At all times, the Ombudsman must follow the principles of independence, impartiality, informality and confidentiality, in accordance with international best practices. 
 
14. The Ombudsman may be removed for cause in accordance with his/her contract by the Director-General. The Staff Association shall be consulted prior to a decision to remove or replace the Ombudsman.  
 
15. Retaliation against any staff member who uses the services of the Ombudsman is expressly prohibited. 
 
Mediation 
 
16. Mediation is an informal conflict resolution process in which parties use the services of a mediator in a good-faith attempt to resolve a workplace concern dispute or grievance. 
 
17. Mediation can be conducted by the Ombudsman or, if considered appropriate by the Ombudsman, by an external mediator designated for the case. Mediators are responsible for conducting the mediation process according to professional best standards of practice, including confidentiality, impartiality, self-determination and informality. Mediators are not decision makers over the substance of the matter being mediated. Instead, they help participants communicate their points of view, concerns, priorities, interests and needs.  
 

 
67 
 
18. A request for mediation may be made by any staff member about any type of workplace concerns and disputes. A case may also be referred to mediation by a supervisor and/or by human resources.  
 
19. A staff member or former staff member may request mediation before initiating the internal appeal process under Staff Rule 12.3.  If so, the time to request the appeal will be temporarily stayed to conduct the intake and mediation. If the mediation closes without an agreement, the staff member will have the remainder of the time to request the appeal but in no case not less than 5 days from close of the mediation process.  
 
20. A case undergoing an internal appeal process under Staff Rule 12.3 may be referred to mediation upon agreement between the staff member or former staff member and GGGI. If the case is referred to mediation, the formal process will be stayed to conduct the mediation process. If the mediation closes without an agreement, the case will return to continue the formal process at the point in which it was referred. 
 
21. Once a mediation is requested or a case referred to mediation, individual intakes with each party are conducted to clarify the purpose of mediation, its ground rules, and assess whether the case is appropriate for mediation. 
 
22. Those with a legitimate advisory role to the parties (i.e. Human Resources, Staff Association, etc.) can participate in mediation by invitation from a party.   
 
23. The entire mediation process is confidential. This confidentiality includes all communications during the preparation of the mediation and the implementation of the agreement. The mediator and all participants in the mediation are prohibited from disclosing any new information learned during the mediation process to individuals outside the process, except those with a legitimate advisory role who have had a role in the mediation process.  
 
24. The mediator or any participant in mediation shall not be compelled to be a witness in any formal grievance processes about cases in which they have participated. The parties cannot disclose confidential information learned in mediation during any subsequent formal process.   
 
25. Mediation is deemed closed when i) the case is deemed by the mediator not appropriate for mediation; ii) when a party withdraws from the process after the first session; iii) when the mediator decides to close the case or iv) when the parties reach an agreement. 
 
26. If the dispute is settled through mediation, the parties enter into an agreement which records the agreement reached by the parties (Mediation Agreement). The Mediation Agreement is a final, binding resolution to all the issues included in it. The mediated agreement shall not create a precedent, and by signing the agreement neither party admits fault. The terms of the Mediation Agreement are confidential and may be shared only with those with legitimate advisory roles or with those that need to know for implementation purposes. 
 
27. In the event of allegations of breach of the terms of the Mediation Agreement, the parties will refer the matter to mediation for assistance.
